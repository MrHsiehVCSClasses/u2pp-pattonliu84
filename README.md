# Empty Project Template
The purpose of this project is to establish an instrument store, where users may create their own instruments with specific attributes, and to which the program will respond with a randomly generated price tag. To provide inspiration for which instruments to be created, an option four is provided for a random instrument to be selected. 
To start the program, users must click run on the executable file, in this case, the Main.java. For Github, user must download the code through: src/main/java/instrumentStore/ to find Main.java. Clicking main/java/instrumentStore will expose the 3 subclasses and 1 superclass. After being prompted to select a value between 1, 2, 3, and 4, with each value representing a specific instrument type (Except 4). Each specific subclass, namely Percussion, Strings (mispelled as Strang for differentiating purposes), and Wind, are the three common ways which sounds are created. Practically all instruments may fall under one of three categories, and specific questions with a specific attribute input are provided with subclasses. As for superclass, universally, number of playable sounds (valves, keys, strings, drums, etc), name of instrument, and genre of instrument is shared. 
Users may note that if selecting a number greater than 4, the program will prompt the user to try for a different number. Entering a negative number may quit the store.
